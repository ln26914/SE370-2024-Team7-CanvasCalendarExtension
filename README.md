# CS370-2024Group7-CanvasCalendarUtility

A standalone application to help people track their canvas assignments more reliably.
This was originally supposed to be a browser extension, but since Chrome extensions don't support Java, it's now a standalone application.

Requires an internet connection in order to populate the calendar. Assignments are not stored locally, so the application must be connected to the internet whenever you attempt to fetch assignments by refreshing the calendar.
